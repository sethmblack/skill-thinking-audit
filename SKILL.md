# Thinking Audit

Assess whether genuine thinking is occurring or whether cliches, rules, and stock phrases have replaced reflection. Based on Hannah Arendt's analysis of thinking as the internal dialogue of the self with itself.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating decision-making processes
- Analyzing arguments and justifications
- Understanding organizational or institutional failures
- Examining public discourse and rhetoric
- Personal reflection on one's own mental habits

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | Decision-making process, argument, justification, or discourse to assess |
| context | No | Situation in which the thinking occurs |
| stakes | No | What depends on genuine thinking here |

---

## What Is Thinking?

Arendt defines thinking as "the soundless dialogue between me and myself." It is:

- **Internal conversation:** Two-in-one dialogue within consciousness
- **Dissolving:** Thinking questions what is taken for granted
- **Non-productive:** It does not yield definite results or rules
- **Conscience-forming:** Those who think develop an internal check

**What thinking is NOT:**
- Following rules or procedures
- Applying formulas to situations
- Reaching predetermined conclusions
- Accepting what everyone accepts

**The danger of non-thinking:** "The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil." They simply fail to think.

---

## Signs of Genuine Thinking

### 1. Questioning the Unquestioned

- Asking "Why?" about things taken for granted
- Examining premises before accepting conclusions
- Doubting comfortable assumptions
- Recognizing when something doesn't add up

### 2. Perspective-Taking

- Imagining how the situation appears to others
- Considering viewpoints that challenge one's own
- Asking "What would this mean for someone affected?"
- Moving beyond one's own position

### 3. Discomfort with Easy Answers

- Recognizing complexity
- Resisting premature closure
- Staying with difficulty rather than fleeing to cliches
- Acknowledging what is not known

### 4. Self-Dialogue

- Examining one's own reasoning
- Asking "Can I live with this decision?"
- Noticing contradictions in one's own position
- Revising views in light of reflection

---

## Signs of Non-Thinking

### 1. Cliche-Substitution

Stock phrases replace genuine reflection:

- "It is what it is"
- "We've always done it this way"
- "That's just how things work"
- "Everyone does it"
- "I'm just following orders/policy/procedure"
- Technical jargon that obscures rather than clarifies

### 2. Rule-Following Without Reflection

- Applying procedures regardless of appropriateness
- Treating compliance as sufficient justification
- Never asking what rules are for
- Confusing legality with morality

### 3. Perspective Failure

- Unable or unwilling to see from another's standpoint
- Affected people are abstractions, not real
- Consequences are someone else's problem
- "That's not my department"

### 4. Resistance to Questions

- Treating questions as attacks
- Demanding conformity to conclusions
- Impatience with complexity
- "Just tell me what to do"

### 5. Ideological Closure

- Every question has a predetermined answer
- Facts are fitted to framework, not vice versa
- Contradictory evidence is dismissed or explained away
- System is unfalsifiable

## The Audit Process

### Step 1: Identify What Is Being Assessed

What decision, argument, discourse, or process requires examination?

### Step 2: Look for Cliches and Stock Phrases

| Statement | Cliche? | What It Replaces |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| [quote] | Yes/No | [genuine thought it substitutes for] |

### Step 3: Examine Rule-Following

- Are rules being followed mechanically?
- Is there reflection on whether rules apply?
- Is compliance confused with correctness?

### Step 4: Assess Perspective-Taking

- Have affected parties been genuinely considered?
- Can participants articulate others' viewpoints?
- Is imagination engaged?

### Step 5: Test for Self-Dialogue

- Is reasoning examined, or assumed?
- Are contradictions noticed?
- Is there capacity for revision?

### Step 6: Evaluate Openness to Questions

- How are challenges received?
- Is complexity acknowledged?
- Can uncertainty be tolerated?

### Step 7: Overall Assessment

Is genuine thinking occurring, or has non-thinking taken over?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs
```markdown
## Thinking Audit

### Subject
[What is being assessed]

### Cliche Analysis

| Statement | Assessment | What's Missing |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| [quote] | Cliche/Genuine | [thought replaced] |

### Rule-Following Assessment
[Mechanical or reflective?]

### Perspective-Taking Assessment
[Present or absent?]

### Self-Dialogue Assessment
[Evidence of internal questioning?]

### Openness to Questions
[How challenges are received]

### Overall Diagnosis
**Thinking Status:** Active / Partial / Absent
**Primary Failure Mode:** [cliche-substitution / rule-following / perspective failure / closure]
**Risk Level:** [what's at stake when thinking fails here]

### Recommendations
[How to recover genuine thinking in this context]
```

---

## Constraints

- This is not about intelligence—intelligent people can be non-thinkers
- Recognize that thinking is difficult; non-thinking is the default
- Distinguish genuine complexity from evasion
- Some contexts require rules—the question is whether reflection accompanies them
- The goal is not paralysis but examined action

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "Our company decided to implement a surveillance system for remote workers. When I raised concerns, I was told 'It's industry standard' and 'Legal approved it' and 'If you're doing your job, you have nothing to worry about.'"

**Output:**

## Thinking Audit

### Subject
Decision to implement employee surveillance; responses to concerns

### Cliche Analysis

| Statement | Assessment | What's Missing |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| "It's industry standard" | Cliche | Analysis of whether industry standard is right for this situation |
| "Legal approved it" | Rule-following cliche | Confusion of legality with ethical appropriateness |
| "Nothing to worry about if doing your job" | Cliche | Consideration of trust, dignity, what surveillance communicates |

### Rule-Following Assessment

**Mechanical.** The responses invoke procedure (legal approval) and conformity (industry standard) without examining whether the decision is appropriate. No evidence that decision-makers asked: What does this do to our relationship with employees? What does it assume about them? What kind of workplace does this create?

### Perspective-Taking Assessment

**Absent.** The response "nothing to worry about if doing your job" shows complete failure to imagine the employee perspective:
- What does it feel like to be monitored?
- What does it communicate about trust?
- What behaviors does it encourage beyond "doing your job"?
- How does constant surveillance affect human beings?

Employees appear as objects to be managed, not as people with legitimate concerns.

### Self-Dialogue Assessment

**No evidence.** Responses are defensive, not reflective. No indication that decision-makers asked themselves:
- "Would I want to work under this surveillance?"
- "Can I defend this as something more than 'everyone does it'?"
- "What are we saying about who we are as an organization?"

### Openness to Questions

**Closed.** Your concerns were met with cliches designed to end discussion, not engage with it. Questions are treated as obstacles to manage, not opportunities to think.

### Overall Diagnosis

**Thinking Status:** Absent

**Primary Failure Mode:** Cliche-substitution combined with perspective failure. Stock phrases (industry standard, legal approved, nothing to hide) prevented genuine examination of what the decision means.

**Risk Level:** Moderate-to-high. When organizations stop thinking about how they treat people, they create conditions for worse failures. The surveillance itself may be less damaging than the non-thinking culture it reveals.

### Recommendations

1. **Replace cliches with questions:**
   - "Industry standard" should prompt: "Is industry standard what we want to be?"
   - "Legal approved" should prompt: "Legal sets the floor. What's our standard?"
   - "Nothing to hide" should prompt: "Is absence of things to hide sufficient for human dignity?"

2. **Require perspective-taking:**
   - Before implementation, require decision-makers to articulate the employee perspective genuinely
   - Include employee voice in the decision

3. **Create space for genuine dialogue:**
   - Concerns should trigger reflection, not defensive cliches
   - Model the behavior you want: leaders who think out loud

4. **Ask the conscience question:**
   - "If this became public, would we be proud of how we made this decision?"
   - Not "Can we defend it?" but "Is it who we want to be?"

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Hannah Arendt** expert persona. Use it to identify when thinking has been replaced by non-thinking—and why this matters.

**Arendt's insight:** "Cliches, stock phrases, adherence to conventional, standardized codes of expression and conduct have the socially recognized function of protecting us against reality, that is, against the claim on our thinking attention that all events and facts make by virtue of their existence."
